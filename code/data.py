        Climate change and regulatory rollbacks spell doom for threatened and endangered species.

        But along the New Jersey coastline, one species is making a comeback. Seabeach amaranth, an Atlantic Coast native once thought extirpated from the state, has rebounded despite long odds, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe said recently.

        Seabeach amaranth, a threatened species, is just one of six federally endangered or threatened plants in New Jersey. It’s an annual plant with short bunches of spinach-like leaves trimmed in light red, supported by fleshy red stalks.  Biologists from the state and the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey counted 7,195 plants — a 600 percent increase — during the 2019 survey, conducted on beaches south of Sandy Hook.

        More than 1,500 of the plants were found at Ocean County’s Island Beach State Park, state officials said. Just 300 were found at the park in 2018.

        “The reaction is delight,” said Jay Kelly, a Raritan Valley Community College professor and state rare plants researcher who has studied seabeach amaranth for nearly two decades. “The work we’ve done is really paying off.”

        Much of the success, Kelly said, has to do with the “cultural inertia of how we’re managing beaches.”

        The primary threats to the rare plant are beach rakes and off-road vehicles, which can destroy habitat.

        Now, all state parks and some coastal municipalities have staked off the back third of beaches. Those areas tend to be drier, hotter and less favorable for recreation — but they’re prime habitat for seabeach amaranth.

        “You can satisfy recreation and natural resources,” Kelly said. “It’s not really impacting recreation at all.” The plant protection areas have also helped piping plovers, which are threatened shorebirds that often nest in the places where seabeach amaranth grows. The two species have a symbiotic relationship, Kelly said.

        The birds are just one of several populations that are coming back on their own thanks to a relatively cheap and simple beach management solution.

        “I am very pleased that the statewide resurgence of seabeach amaranth experienced in 2018 has been far exceeded this year,” McCabe said. “While the increase can be the result of many different factors, it could not have occurred without the presence and structural integrity of the habitat required by this species.”

        The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service placed seabeach amaranth on the federal threatened species list in 1993.

        But it disappeared from New Jersey long before that. Between 1913 and 2000, scientists couldn’t find any of the plants in the Garden State.

        Two decades ago, it was rediscovered in Monmouth County. Its revival, researchers say, has been remarkable.

        Kelly was the first to survey the plant when it reappeared. Starting in North Branch, he walked 120 miles, marking, measuring and recording plants from dawn to dusk. At night, he slept on the beach.

        “It was really rewarding to get to know so intimately the entire length of a habitat,” he said. “It was really fascinating for me.”

        That was Kelly’s strategy for seven years. These days, he has student interns helping with surveys.

        But he still helps researchers in the field get access to places like Little Beach Island, believed to be the last uninhabited barrier island on the Atlantic coast — and which happens to be seabeach amaranth habitat.

        Seabeach amaranth is usually found on overwash flats, parts of barrier beaches that are sparsely vegetated and heavy with pure sand, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In many areas, only a foot or two of beach are suitable habitat, Kelly said.

        The plants don’t stay put, he added. Waves and wind scatter the plant’s seeds and inundate existing vegetation, making it tough to determine how much seabeach amaranth will spring up each year.

        Sea level rise, warming temperatures and abnormal precipitation have affected the species — as have developments like riprap and seawalls designed to protect shoreline communities. And natural disasters can wipe out potential habitats in a single swipe.

        “Staff of the Division of Parks and Forestry and its many partners and supporters should take a bow for their contribution to the resurgence of this very interesting and specialized plant,” said Parks and Forestry Director Olivia Glenn.

        “Of course,” Glenn added, “if a little bit of luck was involved, we are thankful for that, too.”

        Even with this year’s success, Kelly said, the initiative is in its early stages. In the future, researchers will focus on expanding available corridors of potential habitat.

        “We’re hard-pressed to find conservation success stories,” Kelly said. “It’s just nice to have a win-win situation.”

    GOSHEN – It may seem like the world has been turned upside down. OK, it has.

In the course of weeks, the once impossible has become commonplace, as the unprecedented efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 have become part of daily life.

But the world still turns and spring is underway. Bulbs are up and blooming. For Pat Sutton, who has worked for decades to encourage a natural approach to gardening, this is a perfect moment to spend time in the garden, allowing her to be outside while maintaining that all-important social distance.

“Those of us with wildlife gardens are perfectly content right now to walk out the door and be in our gardens,” she said. “They sustain us.  They give us joy.  They entertain us.  They are full of so much life!”

According to Sutton, most lawns and gardens in the region offer little to wildlife. Her life’s work has been to encourage people to plant native species, and she believe now is a great time to start.

The first step could be an inventory of the plants already growing nearby. She suggested taking an inventory of everything growing in the yard, including weeds. Especially the plants people think of as weeds.

For instance, purple dead-nettle, sometimes known as red dead-nettle, is a tiny, wild-growing plant that is among the first to bloom in the spring, showing delicate purple flowers. Sutton used to pull it from her garden – it’s not a native species, originating in Europe and Asia – she now leaves it as it sprouts. Along with dandelion, another species introduced to the Americas, it provides some much-needed color and pollen for the early insects that depend on it.

For Sutton, gardening is about the aesthetics, but it’s also about the wildlife that depend on local plants.

Many species of butterfly will only lay eggs on specific plants, most famously the monarch. The black and orange butterflies are very visible locally as they swarm along the Jersey Cape in late summer and early fall, preparing for their long migration to Mexico.  As caterpillars, the insects eat only milkweed, and that is the only kind of plant on which the females will lay their eggs. There are multiple other examples of local and migrating birds and butterflies that depend on indigenous plants, both for food and as a home to the next generation. Many songbirds will eat seeds and other food, but depend on caterpillars to feed their young, Sutton said.

Most who do survey the plants near their homes will find the majority of the plants are not native, from the grass on the lawn to the flowers in the garden and the trees in the yard. It may include English ivy, Norway maple and ornamental pear trees.

They may look lovely in the garden but do nothing for most wildlife.

“To our butterflies and moths, they may as well be plastic,” Sutton said. With non-native species in place in yards throughout the county and around the country, it’s getting tougher for wildlife to find habitat. Sutton believes this can change, if enough people get inspired to plant native species.

“I think people like birds. I think they like butterflies,” she said.

Her mission to support planting local species began when she started working as a naturalist at the Cape May Point State Park in the 1970s. The park is one of the best places in the region, and perhaps in the nation, to see migrating birds. She described her time there as a great experience.

“I was inspired by it. I felt I was really at the epicenter of the migration, watching the interaction between native plants and migrating birds,” she said. Later, working with the Cape May Bird Observatory, she continued to offer workshops in native plants.

Since she retired in 2007, Sutton has continued her mission, presenting at conferences and teaching at library branches, at least before the current crisis brought an end to public gatherings. She also uses her website, patsuttonwildlifegarden.com, to continue to reach people with her message of gardening for wildlife.

Local plant sales have increased over the years, and the library workshops have drawn crowds.

“The neat thing about those programs is I’m reaching people I hadn’t reached before,” she said. “So there’s keen interest.

Native plants are also more resistant to native pests and to the local climate, which means less need for watering or the use of artificial fertilizers or pesticides.

For now, it may be difficult to acquire native plants until current restrictions are lifted. But there are websites that offer native plant seeds and seedlings for mail order. For families with restless kids at home, a sunny afternoon in the garden may be both educational and a needed break from new updates. With an eye for detail, children can be great help in the initial survey.

“Imaging the kids right now that are being home schooled. They may notice a little weedy thing coming up in your yard and be able to put a name to it. They might see some of the first butterflies of the year nectaring on this,” she said.

According to Sutton, potential gardeners do not need a lot of space. She cited a friend who has a five-foot-by-10-foot space at a townhouse planned for a natural garden.

“That’s all she has to garden with, but she is going to make that count,” Sutton said.

        The Trust for Public Land is using tons of data thanks to a new tool, combined with community input, to spruce up the city’s parks. The goal: prepare Camden for the climate crisis.
        As the climate crisis looms, cities like Camden are on the frontlines of warming temperatures and rising sea levels. That’s why The Trust for Public Lands (TPL) is taking steps to prepare.

        The national nonprofit recently released its Green + Healthy Camden decision-making tool, a publicly available mapping portal with over 100 layers of data. Essentially, the tool helps urban planners decide where to implement parks and green infrastructure, in order to maximize impact and achieve equity.

        According to Danielle Denk, Camden Program Director for TPL, the tool will serve as the foundation for the City of Camden’s five-year parks plan, a project between TPL and Cooper’s Ferry Partnership, expected for release in Spring 2020.  In addition, the plan will guide TPL and partners as they work to add and improve green spaces throughout Camden. Currently, TPL is conducting community outreach in order to understand what Camden residents want and need from the city’s park system.

        “[TPL will] then align that information with what we know parks can provide to help address obesity issues, to help address mental health issues, help address heat island issues, help address flooding and also to really help Camden become more resilient to climate change,” Denk said.

        The Power of Parks

        But let’s back up. What do parks have to do with climate adaptation? A lot, actually.

        Parks and other green spaces are filled with native plants, grass, and trees. That greenery is crucial to buffering shoreline communities from flooding and storms; connecting trails that facilitate carbon-free transit; providing shade to combat heatwaves and reduce home energy use; and saving energy for water management by absorbing rainfall.

        All of those benefits are especially crucial in Camden. The city, which experiences a 42 percent poverty rate, lacks the tree coverage that much wealthier communities enjoy. As a result, it suffers from much higher temperatures.

        Further, Camden, like much of Philly, uses a combined sewer system, an outdated form of infrastructure that carries sewage and stormwater through the same pipes. The combined volume overwhelms the system during wet weather events, causing it to back up into the streets and discharge into nearby waterways without treatment.

        The climate crisis will only increase rainfall, as well as temperatures, in the coming years. That’s why Camden needs more parks and green spaces to absorb stormwater, provide cooling shade, and protect residents from flooding.

        Projects in Progress: A Sneak Peak
        That’s where The Trust for Public Lands (TPL) comes in. The organization began working in Camden two years ago, at the request of the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority (CCMUA), to add and improve parks in the city.

        Since then, TPL has launched four parks-related projects, all of which advance two of TPL’s programs, Parks for People and Climate-Smart Cities.

        The furthest along: improvements to the Cooper’s Poynt Family School playground. Previously an expanse of cracked and barren asphalt, TPL has converted it to a community asset, adding new, colorful play equipment and basketball courts. For the final phase, TPL and CCMUA plan to add rain gardens that will manage stormwater, mitigate flooding and connect students to nature.

        The projects serve as a preview for the kind of initiatives Camden can look forward to under the incoming five-year plan. They’re an example of how, through its data and community-driven parks projects, TPL is hoping to not just prepare Camden for the climate crisis, but also improve residents’ overall quality of life.

        “The ultimate plan needs to both be something that works for the people of Camden and also puts Camden in position to be resilient and sustainable and an amazing place to live and work,” Denk said.

    OCEAN CITY – In most lifetimes, there are only a few chances to participate in the birth of an industry, Kris Ohleth told a group of businesspeople gathered at The Flanders Hotel Feb. 25.

This is one of those times, she said.

Ohleth is the senior manager for stakeholder engagement of Orsted, the Danish energy firm that has the contract to build Ocean Wind, the first wind farm off New Jersey, a massive installation planned for about 15 miles off the coast, set to power about a half-million homes when it powers up in 2024.

The multimillion-dollar proposal is the first in a series, a major part of Gov. Phil Murphy’s plan to move the state entirely to green energy by 2050.

Economic Impact
At the event, presented by the Cape May County Chamber of Commerce, a packed ballroom heard details about the plans and the projected economic impact. Jobs were the focus of the day, and attendees heard that the project will directly create about 3,000 jobs.

Most of those will be in the construction of the massive installation, but there will also be hundreds of new jobs in the maintenance and operation of the wind turbines.

Ohleth said that the United States is already a generation behind Northern Europe in offshore wind power, citing an Orsted installation built close to 30 years ago.

The American Northeast combines three important features that make projects like Ocean Wind feasible.

She showed a slide with three images, including one showing the lights of the East Coast from space.

“You can see there’s a huge coastal electricity demand between Boston and Washington, D.C.,” she said, pointing to the yellowish glow of multiple cities. “Coincident to that is a tremendous offshore wind source, really a world-class wind resource,” she added.

The winds along the East Coast ocean are strong and steady through most of the year.

Finally, the continental shelf extends into the ocean. Oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico may extend thousands of feet to the bottom, she said, but for miles off of New Jersey the water is 60 to 100 feet deep, making the engineering relatively easy.

Describing herself as a “Jersey girl,” Ohleth said wind projects will run from Massachusetts to Virginia, but she said she is proud New Jersey will be a leader.

“New Jersey is kind of at the center of the universe here. It’s at the center of the offshore wind universe,” she said.

The sold-out, paid event included opportunities to network with Orsted employees and the third-party organizations that will have contracts on the project, including those that will hire the fleet of boats expected to ferry workers to the offshore construction sites.

According to Ohleth, big opportunities are on the way.

“This is not just about Ocean Winds. This is not just about New Jersey. This is about a regional industry that we all have the opportunity to participate in,” she said. Commercial Fishing Concerns
Not everyone was as sanguine about the proposal.

Jeff Kaelin, of Lunds Fisheries, presented a slide that showed the overlap of the project area for Ocean Wind with the path of fishing boats in the region.

“The clam guys fish inside of there,” he said.

Kaelin stated that the fishing industry would face a disproportionate impact from the wind energy proposal. He described commercial fishing as a $6-billion industry that employs about 30,000 people in a half-dozen different ports, including the Lunds facility, near the Middle Thorofare Bridge, just in from Cape May Inlet.

He said they are meeting with Orsted “constantly,” an evaluation later confirmed by Ohleth, but he suggested that the number of jobs promised may be high.

He cited a report from Scotland that indicated the number of jobs from an offshore wind project fell short of projections.

“Our goal is to coexist – you’ve heard that a couple of times already – but not be replaced in a rush to create new jobs that may or may not materialize,” Kaelin said.

Lund’s has its roots in the 1970s, he said, when new regulations kept foreign fishing trawlers out of American waters.

When it started, there were few regulations on the industry. After more than 40 years, catch limits and regulations have been imposed.

“Literally every pound of fish that comes out of American waters and New Jersey waters today is by definition sustainable,” he said, suggesting that wind energy projects should face similar care and evaluation.

“Healthy skepticism as we move toward coexistence, I think,” he said.

Consider Tourism
Also at the program, Cape May County tourism director Diane Wieland described the importance of tourism to the county and the state.

At no point in her presentation did she suggest the massive wind turbine installation would hurt tourism, but she drove home the importance of tourism in the region. It is by far the county’s biggest economic engine, she said, with most Cape May County jobs directly dependent on tourism.

It’s a multibillion-dollar industry, she said, and surveys show most visitors to Cape May County come for the beach.

At another presentation in Ocean City earlier this month, Orsted officials presented graphics showing the massive wind turbines will be visible from the beach. The highest point of the turbine blade will be more than 900 feet off the water. Benefits Quizzed
In her presentation, Wieland offered a series of questions under the heading “what we don’t know.” Among them, she questioned the benefits and impacts of the projects to the county, its impacts on ecotourism and fishing, whether the structures will cause migrating whales and dolphins to move farther offshore and whether boat tours will be able to get in viewing range of the project.

Seeking New Jobs
As part of the same discussion, Chamber of Commerce President Vicki Clark said the chamber and the county have sought ways to bring new kinds of jobs to the county.

“There’s a real opportunity for diversifying economic prosperity in Cape May County from our traditional industries,” she said. That includes tourism and fishing. “Now we have this emerging offshore wind industry in the county.”

The event was the start of a conversation on engaging with the new industry, and finding ways for individuals to apply for jobs, she said.

“But also, we want to make sure that we develop the opportunity for the new offshore wind industry to coexist without displacing our historic and very prosperous industries of tourism and commercial fishing, without displacing the valuable industries that we already have,” she said.

Energy Future
Joseph Fiordaliso, president of the state Board of Public Utilities, opened the day discussing the reason for the wind energy project.

“We just completed our energy master plan, so if you have trouble sleeping one night, if I may make a suggestion, bring it up on your computer and read it,” he said. “It’s only 250 pages. Not a lot of pictures, but it lays out the road map to get us to our goal of a carbon-neutral 2050.”

Wind is a prominent part of the plan, as is solar energy and conservation and energy efficiency. A community solar program aims to bring solar energy to low- and moderate-income residents.

“If we’re going to really attack climate change, it’s not going to just take the people in this room. It’s going to take everybody,” Fiordaliso said. He said the buildup of carbon in the atmosphere is not just a New Jersey problem or an American problem.

Expensive? Yes, but Beneficial
Orsted expects to begin generating power by 2024. Fiordaliso said the state plans to solicit more projects in the effort, with a new goal of 7,500 megawatts by 2035.

“Again a very ambitious goal, but one that’s possible and one we will achieve, and I will ask you, again, is it expensive? And I will tell you yes, but let’s look at the economic benefits of wind,” he said.

More businesses will develop, jobs will be created and manufacturing will return to New Jersey, he said.

        DENNISVILLE – It can be tough getting students excited about learning. Kevin Poltorak, a seventh and eighth-grade science teacher, in Dennis Township, found it can help if they get their hands dirty.

Poltorak launched a program in sustainability as an elective, and often incorporates environmental issues into his classes.

For the past few years, students have raised outdoor gardens within their school’s courtyard, getting hands-on experience while learning about photosynthesis, biology, and other science topics.

This year, students could also sign up for a gardening elective, which is featured in a new series of programs for a free period based on the students’ interests.

“We talked about what sustainability is and simple ways that you can achieve it, and the ways in which our school goes about trying to be as sustainable as possible,” Poltorak said.

Students created compost buckets out of steel coffee cans with lids. Participating teachers have taken them home to add fruit peels, apple cores and other scraps from vegetables, which will eventually break down and help fertilize the school garden beds.

“It’s pretty small scale right now. It’s something brand new,” he added. “Eventually, it would be nice to make it more of a school-wide thing.”

Compostable items could one day be collected in the cafeteria, he said, for a larger-scale project.

Even at a small scale, he said, working outside and seeing how water, soil and seeds come together gives his students a deeper understanding than they could get from lectures and reading.

“They love being in the garden,” he said.

Creating Close Connections
The Alliance for New Jersey Environmental Education works under a theory, said ANJEE President Mike Chodroff: You won’t save what you don’t love. Or put another way, people will work to protect things they care about.

Part of getting people to care about the environment is teaching them about it, and the kinds of direct methods Poltorak is bringing to his classroom is a great way to do that, Chodroff said in a recent interview.

“We encouraged experimental learning, so that students are connected to what they are learning,” he said.

ANJEE makes connections, Chodroff said, between teachers and school districts and other resources. He said the organization also works with environmental educators outside of the school system, such as the Nature Center, in Cape May, the Wetlands Institute and the Cape May County Zoo.

One trend Chodroff finds inspiring is a push from students for more environmental education. Some have launched environmental clubs on their campuses or have lobbied for more classes connected to environmental sciences.

He sees Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg as an inspiration to young people around the world. Her campaign, calling for immediate action on climate issues, drew international attention and landed her on the cover of Time magazine, as the 2019 Person of the Year.

Chodroff sees her and other young activists as an example of what the next generation can accomplish. He also pointed to student activists in marginalized communities. Activists have, for years, worried that environmentalism was seen as a concern for rich white people. Chodroff sees that narrative changing with the younger generation.

“There are just so many incredible kids that are recognizing that change starts in their community,” he said.

They also see real-world impacts of environmental issues, in air and water quality in their communities. He expects that aspect to be a big thrust for his organization in 2020.

Sustainable Lessons across the Board
Dr. Nancy Hudanich has taught math. Now the superintendent of Cape May County Technical School, she knows it can be tough for many students to grasp its abstract concepts. However, when students learn the slope equation for a roof with the understanding they will have to use that data to install solar panels, or they dig into the math behind gear ratios when they will later apply those results to a motorbike, the connection is more concrete.

“They’re seeing the need of it, so it’s real-world learning,” Hudanich said.

In a future piece in this series, we’ll look in more detail at how Cape May Tech incorporates sustainability into education. According to Hudanich, concepts and practices in sustainability are part of every class in the district.

“We have sustainability embedded in every career and educational program,” she said.

Keeping Traditions, Creating New Ones
For many of his students, Poltorak said, the idea of getting food from the land is not new.

“We’re a farming community,” he said. Not every family has a farm, of course, but many of his students’ parents have gardens at home, and family members who fish and hunt, he said. There is nothing novel in concepts like locally sourced food and planning for the needs of future generations.

Poltorak said he has been able to introduce the students to concepts they had not considered.

In the corner of his classroom stands a multi-level hydroponic growing system, which recycles water past the plant roots. The system uses less water than other growing methods, and also offers a means of growing food close to demand. That means less fuel used to transport and deliver the food.

With a little more than 6,000 people spread over close to 65 square miles, Dennis Township is a rural area, even by Cape May County standards.

Encompassing numerous small farms, preserved wetlands and the dense woods of Belleplain State Forest, along with residential development and the historic village of Dennisville, Dennis township was the first municipality carved out of the original division of Cape May County between Upper, Middle, and Lower townships, predating the borough that was to become Cape May by several decades.

There are two schools for Dennis Township’s kindergarten-through-eighth grade district, with a total of 564 students, according to recent statistics. Students then attend Middle Township High School or Cape May County Technical High School.

While Cape May County fills in the summer, the county is relatively empty, for most of the year, at least when compared to the rest of the state. With more than 8.9 million people, New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the union, with extensive urban and industrial areas.

Even in urban districts, Chodroff said, there is usually room for a few plants or a corner garden to give students hands-on growing experience. He said his organization is looking for more student voices to help lead efforts on sustainability in the 2020s.

“What’s really great that’s going on in schools is that students are very aware now of challenges we will face in the future,” he said. “Many are being very proactive, starting environmental clubs and getting more involved, even asking for more environmental courses.”

    David Dichter doesn’t want to change the entire world. Just a little bit of it.

Dichter, 88, a retired geologist from Linwood with a cache of global experience, wants Atlantic City to become the international focal point for addressing global warming and climate change.

Atlantic City is in the right place at the right time, and Dichter believes he is close to making it happen.

Casinos may be the big attraction in the resort, but Dichter believes his idea will pump new life — and bring new dollars — into the city while tackling a global threat. And he’s making progress. So far, his idea has garnered the support of state Senate President Steve Sweeney, Atlantic City’s planning department, City Council, Meet AC (the city’s convention arm) and the Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders.

“It will enable scientists, academicians, climate experts, governmental officials and concerned citizens from throughout the country and internationally to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss, as well as successfully act, on this global menace,” according to a resolution passed in September 2016 by City Council.

“I could not agree more that it is an ideal place for the international community to come together to work towards solutions,” Sweeney wrote about the idea.

Atlantic City has all the elements needed to become a hub to increase interest in and enact change on sustainability issues, Dichter says, including the resort’s location, hotels, dining facilities, beaches, Boardwalk and convention space. Right now, he says, the United Nations’ specialized agency for climate change is in Nairobi, Kenya, a location that is not only isolated but lacks security for visitors.

“By focusing on Atlantic City, we’re bringing it closer to home,” he says. New York is not a good place, he adds, because it is expensive and crowded.

Dichter has spent the past three years gathering support and believes if he is successful in getting the backing of the last two hurdles — the governor and casino owners — his idea will come to fruition.

“We’re trying to offer Atlantic City another alternative other than just gambling,” he says, “which in my view is a dead-end street.”

Some of the topics that could be addressed are climate change, oceanography, water quality and sea level rise.

“I’m scared to death,” he says of global conditions. “I really am afraid. We have too many people, not enough resources and it’s adding up to total mass confusion and troubles. Global warming is simply a manifestation of all the things that are going wrong with the stewardship we have of the planet.”

Dichter has spent his life confronting issues in the United States and abroad. Born on Atlantic City’s New Jersey Avenue, where his father ran the Dichter Hotel, he has watched his hometown change from the summer-tourist town of his youth to a community powered by global casino corporations. After graduating from Atlantic City High School, he followed a yearning to travel that led him to college in northern India, graduate school in Massachusetts and studies in London for his Ph.D. in economics and political geography.

Among his many jobs, he served in the Peace Corps in Afghanistan, served as a U.S. Foreign Service officer in Thailand and Burma, headed a Geneva-based organization that led to the creation of a U.N. Volunteer Program and a service organization, Technology for the People, that matched technology related to sustainability with enterprises and was the basis for a handbook in the technology/enterprise field. When he returned home, Dichter did a three-year stint in the Marines, serving mostly in Japan, took a solo motorcycle trip from India to Eastern Europe as a young man in 1954 and was a candidate for Congress against Charlie Sandman in 1968.

“I’ve never believed in the philosophy that a single individual can’t make a change in the world,” he said. “If I did, my whole life would have been much less meaningful and much less interesting.”

Dichter’s advice for those who have the desire but don’t believe it’s enough to enact change is to focus on what interests you, things you understand and appreciate, and things you feel you can impact.

“Focus on that, and see where it brings you,” he says.

To that end, he continues to lobby for support of his idea from various levels of government, and anyone who will listen who he believes can forward his cause.

“Dr. Dichter’s initiative to bring sustainability to the forefront for Atlantic City is a fantastic idea,” said Sandi Harvey, vice president of sales for Meet AC. Harvey says Dichter should be admired for the support he’s gained and his continuing outreach.

“It’s the little guy that can make a difference in Atlantic City,” Harvey says. “And we need more folks like Dr. Dichter.”

Entrepreneur Tom Marchetty pours his passion for history, reuse, and innovation into sustainably made furniture. Now, as the finalist in a Camden public art competition, he eyes his next possible project.
Tom Marchetty loves a good backstory. Whether he’s slabbing 300-year-old lumber or servicing old manufacturing machinery, he values the history behind the objects in his care.

But it’s Marchetty’s own backstory that makes him a compelling contender for A New View Camden, a competition among artists bidding to transform six of the city’s vacant, blighted lots into community gathering spaces. Among the 20 finalists, Marchetty, a woodworker and machine specialist, is the only one who grew up in Camden.

But that’s not all: the lot he’s eyeing sits across the street from the building that once housed his father’s business, Marchetty Machinery.

A New View Camden won’t announce the six winning artists until January. Until then, Marchetty is crossing his fingers, hoping he can take part in a project that he thinks will be a gamechanger for Camden, its residents and its environment.

Giving old materials new life in Collingswood’s The Factory Workers
Marchetty, 42, runs The Factory Workers, a coworking and event space in Collingswood, a town just outside Camden. The business is rooted in Marchetty’s childhood, which he spent helping his father service and repair factory equipment in Philadelphia and Camden. According to Marchetty, as more and more factories shut down in the 80’s and 90’s, his family business shifted: clients began paying Marchetty and his father to take the machinery off their hands.

“I never had the heart to take stuff and throw it into a dump, especially good working machines and equipment,” Marchetty said.

Instead, Marchetty Machinery bought and sold them, trying to find each piece of equipment a new home. Eventually, after his father retired and turned the business over to him, Marchetty sold the shop. He gave away as much of the remaining machines as he could, but was still left with more than he could handle. That’s when he dreamed up the idea of his own makerspace.

“If I could find a place where I could put this stuff, and I could use it and other people could use it, it could be a win-win,” Marchetty said.

In 2014, he purchased a 16,000 square foot abandoned movie theater. Built in 1920, the building’s original plastering and custom oil paintings still adorn the walls.

“It was foreclosed on,” Marchetty said of the building. “Somebody left it to die, like these machines.”

Marchetty moved the machines into the space and, for five years, charged customers a monthly fee to use them to create their own furniture, artwork and more. But he was forced to shut down the makerspace due to high insurance costs. Instead, to offset his utility bills, he turned the back of the building into offices. 22 small businesses, from graphic designers to coffee roasters, now rent from Marchetty and work out of the building. Together, they make up The Factory Workers.

“It was like a tribute to all the men and women who lost their jobs in the 80s and 90s,” Marchetty said of the name.

Marchetty also rents out the space for weddings and other events on the weekends. And by day, he uses it as his personal studio. Marchetty began making custom tables a few years ago,  when he decided to donate one to Constellation Collective, a cafe in Collingswood.

“I finally got to do a project for myself, even though it wasn’t for me,” he said. “To get my hands on the equipment and tools again, it just really jump-started.”

Now Marchetty is constantly filling orders for clients ranging from restaurants to his own friends. He makes his tables from repurposed machinery and “urban timber”: reclaimed, locally sourced wood. Sustainability is certainly a motivating factor behind Marchetty choice in materials, but for the most part, he simply prefers working with parts that have a story behind them.

“It’s not because it’s green, but because it’s just better,” he said of the wood he uses. “It’s natural art. You don’t have to do anything with it except bring it back to life. And that’s the fun part.”

Marchetty’s vision for building community in Camden
And while he’s quick to see art in his materials, he hesitates to apply similar labels to himself.

“I just like working with my hands,” he said. “I’m very passionate about what I do, but I’ve never considered myself an artist.”

But the judges for A New View Camden certainly consider him one. Marchetty was recently announced as one of 20 finalists, selected from a pool of 130 applicants. He had submitted a proposal after his friends urged him to check out the project. When he saw that the site at 1401 Federal Street faced the former home of Marchetty Machinery, it felt like fate.

The lot is one of six selected by the project partners, which include the City of Camden, Cooper’s Ferry Partnership, and the Rutgers–Camden Center for the Arts. Most of the sites are hotspots for illegal dumping, a citywide problem that A New View Camden hopes to address.

For his proposal, Marchetty pitched a “pod park,” with mobile, shaded picnic tables and an outdoor art gallery that would display work by Camden residents. And of course, all seating, play equipment and displays would be built, at least partially, out of his own machine parts and other repurposed materials from dumps.

To Marchetty, it made sense to build something that his neighbors could interact with and share, rather than an immobile piece of art. Much like The Factory Workers, his “pod park” is inspired by one core value: community.

“I wasn’t a big fan of just showcasing my work,” Marchetty said. “I’d rather collaborate with other people.”

The 20 finalists in A New View Camden hail from around the world and represent a variety of mediums. While Marchetty is intimidated by the competition, he’s also excited to see international talent flock to his hometown. And he’s optimistic that, whether he wins or not, the project will bring positive attention and development to Camden.

“I wouldn’t want to be one of those judges,” he said. “In my book, every one of those guys was a winner. They all nailed it.”

But if he does win, Marchetty would be thrilled to use the park to tell the story of his family business. After he decided to apply, he took his father to the Federal Street site, where they shared a picnic. Legacy is a powerful driving force behind Marchetty’s work. It even shows itself in his medium of choice: dining tables.

“It’s where families gather,” he said. “Someday, one of these kid’s grandkids are gonna be fighting over this table that I made.”

People also gather at The Factory Workers, for weddings, neighborhood barbeques and family reunions. And hopefully, if his project is selected, Camden will gather at Marchetty’s pod park.

“A big building like this shouldn’t be closed up to the outdoors,” Marchetty said of The Factory Workers. “Same thing with artwork: it should be out there for people to enjoy. That’s what it’s about. I want to live through my work, not work to live.”

    BYOC – as in, bring your own container, is all the buzz in Maplewood these days.

A third business aimed at reducing packaging waste is opening its doors this month: Dry Goods Refillery, which kicks off its soft launch at General Store Cooperative on Springfield Avenue this weekend, with plans to open to the public on Wednesday. It will offer common food and pantry goods in bulk. Other new businesses with similar offerings for household goods include the Good Bottle Refill Shop and The Green Tap.

That means customers can fill up on a variety of items — including dry pasta, rice, cereal, nuts, pretzels, lentils, loose leaf tea, spices, oils, maple syrup, honey and more without adding to their garbage with all the plastic and other packaging commonly used at grocery stores. Despite being a smaller business, owner Rachel Garcia said she aims to keep prices in line with Whole Foods and other grocery stores that offer a bulk-foods section.

Garcia is also going the extra mile in identifying food distributors that are conscious of their environmental footprint. One supplier, Ace Natural of Long Island City, is a carbon neutral company that uses solar-powered trucks. All the teas at the store are fair trade and organic, as are most of the spices. Suppliers include Bob’s Red Mill, Frontier Co-op and Marcelli Formaggi.

“We believe the supply chain starts at the beginning, and we want to do our best to keep that eco-conscious mindset from production through sale,” Garcia said.

For customers, that means letting go of the idea that pantries need to be lined with matching containers and finding ways to reuse old mayonnaise and sauce jars that might otherwise get tossed. The store will have some containers on sale for people who walk in without one.

Although environmental stewardship is a key impetus for the business, it’s not the only reason Garcia felt inspired to launch it. The mom of two with a background in retail has always wanted to open a store and, with Dry Goods Refillery, she aims to harken back to the days before Amazon home delivery. “The whole idea of shopping at a general store is filling up on your groceries and your housewares at the same place. That was very much where we were in the past, before Amazon showed up,” Garcia said.

Operating in the General Store Cooperative also allows her to feel supported as she embarks on this new venture.

“For me, this cooperative is really something special,” she said. “The opportunity to work there is absolutely the reason why I felt it was the right time to open the business. There is a sense of community both from patrons and tenants.” For more information about Dry Goods Refillery on Instagram, visit @drygoodsrefillery. Visit their Facebook page as well.

        South Orange is testing organic methods for maintaining grass turf on a two-acre field in Floods Hill this year to determine whether it can manage the area’s athletic fields without the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

But the real challenge to the fields may have less to do with how they are treated and more with how heavily they are used, according to a turf expert at Rutgers University.

“It’s event after event after event,” said Bradley Park, a laboratory researcher at the university’s Center for Turfgrass Science. “While there is a lot of interest in organic turf management, the real limiting factor that’s affecting the performance of the field is it’s too much traffic.”

At the moment, South Orange and Maplewood have a contract with TruGreen that allows for the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as needed to control weeds that can affect field safety and playability.

“The current contract with TruGreen is for treating our athletic field areas that suffer the most wear and tear,” said Peter Travers, deputy director of recreation and cultural affairs for South Orange. He said the test will span two years and is a way to see whether evolving practices in turf management could work here.

“If there is a method that would reduce the use of synthetics, it would be a more natural program, which is something the Environmental Commission is hoping to achieve,” said Travers.

Although synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are applied as needed on a spot basis and in a manner to ensure that the grass is safe for people to use, South Orange resident George Finlay said the safest method is to not apply such chemicals at all.

“It’s not something you want to do if you can avoid it, especially where children play,” said Finlay, who will be leading the effort to test organic methods on the Floods Hill patch at the corner of Meadowbrook Lane and Meadowbrook Place, where the village hosts outdoor movies and concerts in the summer.

Finlay is particularly concerned about chemicals seeping into the area’s water supply through runoff.

“We’re being constantly bombarded with environmental threats, so it’s important to me to keep the ground as clear of pollutants as possible,” he said, adding that several states and Canadian provinces have banned the use of such materials on children’s play areas.

There is also growing interest among residents of New Jersey towns in attempting chemical-free approaches to managing turf, as evidenced by the launch of a one-day course at Rutgers University on organic turf management, which Finlay recently completed.

“The interest in organic food is in part driving this trend, the perception that it’s higher quality,” said Park, who helps teach the course. “I think that thought process has translated over into the turf analysis space.”

Yet Park says that banning synthetic fertilizer outright really limits the ability to manage turf effectively, and that it can be used alongside organic materials without major environmental consequences. The greatest risk, he adds, is not to children but to workers who apply these materials and are exposed to them in large quantity.

“Most of the materials of concern have been removed from the market in the last 20 years,” he said.

According to Park, the larger challenge is for towns to reduce how much they use athletic fields, so that the grass has sufficient time for seeding, sodding and rest. “We are worried about one thing, whereas the bigger problem is that these fields are getting obliterated because they are getting overused,” he said.

That can be easier said than done in towns like South Orange, which have limited athletic fields and multiple sports teams seeking access.

Floods Hill in particular is heavily used, since it is a common sledding destination in the winter, and is thus used year round.

Finlay acknowledges the problem of field overuse in South Orange and Maplewood, and says the solution may be an artificial turf field that allows sports teams to have a space to play in early spring and late fall – when the grass turf is not quite ready for use. Artificial turf comes with its own environmental problems, including the challenge of finding a way to recycle it.

In the meantime, he is assembling the equipment and volunteers needed to run the field test and is optimistic that he will be able to maintain grass that is as lush and green without the use of chemicals. As awareness around environmental concerns grows, Finlay says the time is ripe to make a change in how the area’s turf is managed.

“What we’re seeing is the younger people moving out of the city, they are more aware of this issue. They don’t just hire a landscape service and say, ‘Make my lawn green,’” he said. “They’re much more aware.”

    Jersey’s own Olivia Bellace runs an eco-conscious business, organizes climate strikes and gives presentations on plastic pollution–all while attending fifth grade.
11-year-old Olivia Bellace of Haddonfield, NJ has a lot on her plate. Between math homework and field hockey practice, the young environmental activist is busy doing what world leaders are failing to: saving the planet.

“It’s turning out that the kids are actually stronger than the adults,” Olivia said. “And that’s kind of weird.”

A fifth-grader at Central Elementary School, Olivia has already established herself as an eco-conscious entrepreneur. Since June 2018, she’s been making and selling colorful knit headbands as part of her small business, ORB Designs. Inspired by companies like 4ocean, which sells bracelets to fund ocean plastic cleanups, Olivia donates a portion of her profits to the ocean conservation campaign Mission Blue. She’s sold headbands at town festivals, farmers’ markets and SHOP, a boutique in Haddonfield.

Reaching for global goals at the local level
“No one’s gonna do anything about it unless you do.“

John Bellace
And while she has her sights set on global change, the origins of Olivia’s activism are local. According to her parents, Olivia used to complain about the litter in Knight Park, which is located across from the family’s former home in Collingswood, NJ.

“After soccer games and little league games, she was noticing the bottles laying around, trash getting blown around,” John, her father, explained. “And we said, ‘No one’s gonna do anything about it unless you do.’”

The family began taking trips to the park to pick up trash. Around the same time, Olivia was tearing through books and documentaries about oceanographer Sylvia Earle, the founder of Mission Blue. Earle has fought to create a worldwide network of preserved areas, called Hope Spots, in which valuable marine life is protected from commercial fishing, deep-sea mining, dumping, and other exploitative activities.

Inspired by Earle’s efforts, Olivia decided to make a slideshow presentation about plastic pollution and its effects on marine life. She showed it to her fourth-grade teachers, who then shared it with the school principal. The principal asked her to present the slideshow at the school’s monthly assembly, and two months later, Olivia was invited to give the presentation at the nearby Elizabeth Haddon Elementary School.

“There were an easy 100 parents in the audience for that one who asked her questions and she responded very articulately,” Olivia’s mother, Jaime, said. Last spring, Olivia built on that momentum by encouraging her classmates to participate in Students Rebuild: The Ocean Challenge. Students Rebuild is a project by the Bezos Family Foundation that encourages teams of K-12 students to make artwork in order to raise awareness and funds for a different global cause every year.

Last year, the cause was ocean conservation, and students were tasked with constructing sculptures of sea creatures out of recycled trash. For every photograph of a sculpture submitted to the challenge site, the Bezos Family Foundation donated $2 to community-based programs focused on educating coastal communities about ocean conservation and coral restoration. Olivia jumped at the opportunity and signed up to run a booth at the 2019 Collingswood Green Festival on April 13. She gathered a team of students, in collaboration with Mark Newbie Elementary School’s Green Team, and recruited festival attendees to pitch in. All in all, the team produced 267 works of art and raised $828.

Setting her sights on solving the climate crisis
“The kids realize that if we can change the course of all this, then Earth will last.”

Olivia Bellace
And while Olivia, an aspiring oceanographer, focuses much of her efforts on protecting marine life and water quality, she also has her sights set on another issue: the climate crisis. She cites Greta Thunberg as one of her heroes, next to Earle.

“She’s only 16,” Olivia said of Thunberg. “And she’s probably stronger than the president.”

Last September, Olivia organized Haddonfield’s own Climate Strike, as part of Thunberg’s FridaysforFuture campaign, with around 30 participants. She plans to organize another strike in the spring.

Next on the agenda: presenting her slideshow on plastic pollution to J. Fithian Tatem Elementary School, another school in her hometown. Her own school’s environmental club is also working on an advocacy campaign to push a plastic bag ban in Haddonfield.

It seems her efforts are having an effect on her peers. Olivia said that her friends are often eager to help with her projects, and after she gives presentations, many of her classmates asked her questions. She even noticed her classmates choosing not to use plastic straws at lunch.

“Some kids even made their own posters and stuck them in the cafeteria: ‘Don’t use the plastic straws for the turtles!’” Olivia said.

According to Olivia, it’s no surprise that her passion for environmentalism is shared by others in her generation.

“The kids realize that if we can change the course of all this, then Earth will last,” she said.
